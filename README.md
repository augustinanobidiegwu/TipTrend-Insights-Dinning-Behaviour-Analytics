## TipTrend-Insights-Dinning-Behaviour-Analytics
This project uses a dataset that captures different aspects of dining experiences to identify patterns and behaviours related to tipping. Information like the total bill, tip amount, gender, preferred smoking day, time of day, and party size are all included in the dataset and used for this analysis. Moreover, the dataset provides insights into tipping tendencies concerning dinning preferences such as smoking and specific days or times. Further exploration and statistical analysis are underway to uncover deeper trends, potentially shedding light on factors influencing tipping behaviour in restaurant settings
